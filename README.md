MY VERY FIRST PROJECT IS ABOUT MY FAVORITE MUSIC BAND.


THE BAND IS NAMED "SCORPIONS", I GOT THE IDEA FROM THE CODE INSTITUTE MODULE WHERE IT WAS SUGGESTING TO CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A 60'S BAND, 
IT IS NOT A BAND FROM 60'S BUT IS MY FAVOURITE ONE :) 


It's purpose is a first look to the band's history and the user to be able to find easily information about the band, upcoming concerts, videos etc.


I found the bootstrap stylesheets and scripts, here: 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/


I found the videos in Youtube and embedded them in to my project.


There are redirections to external links such is Scorpions Official Website, google search, social media etc.


I sourced the codes for the colors online from various websites. 
I have tried to use a responsive design in order to be accessible and viewable on various devices.


>In the Home page, you will see that the backgorund of the webpage is a vintage photo of Scorpions multiple times, you will find a picture of the band, a welcome note, 
options to be navigated to the rest of the pages (Video CLips, Contact Us, About Us, Upcoming concerts and Links) that can navigate you through my project and as a footer you  
will read a disclaimer about my  website not being the official Scorpions website.

>In the VideoCLips page, you can find a big SCORPIONS logo picture at the very top, 7 videoclips that I have embedded from Youtube and as a footer you can find the links to the rest of my project.

>In the CONTACT US page, you can find contact information, you can open externally and choose to download a poster, you can choose to be navigated to the rest of my project, 
you can send me over you suggestions (dummy send option) and at the bottom you can read details about the project and choose to be navigated to the About Us Page.

>In the LINKS page, you can find usefull external links to the Official Scorpions band webpage, the Crazy World Tour, the 50th Anniversary World Tour,
and a biography. Also, you can find at the bottom of the page, a search pane where you can search directly in the google.com or to the official Scorpions webpage and as a footer you
will see a Thank you text.

>In the ABout Us page, you will read about the band's biography, written by Barry Weber as I have found it and copied the text from  
https://www.allmusic.com/artist/scorpions-mn0000299471/biography , you will also find the navigation options to the rest of my project and as a footer a Thank you text.

>In the Upcoming Concerts page, you will be able to find as a header an audio file for a song which can be played by clicking the "play" option,
in case that the file can not be played on your browser, you will be notified with an error message that Your browser does not support the audio element, also 
you can mute the song and you have the option to download the song by clicking on the 3 dots next to the audio bar and choosing the download option.
In the body you will be able to find the upcoming concerts with the dates and countries, at the left side of the webpage you will find icons of social media
that are fixed to that side while you are scrolling up and down and you can be navigated to the Scorpions social media pages.
As a footer you will find the options to be navigated to the rest of my project.



Total of 6 webpages and many external links. Tested and working as expected. Tested as per the responsive design and working as expected.
